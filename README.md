## Project Structure

This project uses the [Astro](https://docs.astro.build) web framework.

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files, though we primarily use `.md` files, in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its path and file name and should correspond with the route of the API endpoint, unless it's a resource or datatype.

The `src/components/` directory includes any Astro components that are reused in the project.

The `src/layouts/` directory is how the framework for pages is defined. This project only has one layout.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
