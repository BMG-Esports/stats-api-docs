# Brawlhalla Stats API

The Brawlhalla Stats API provides a rich API for getting stats based on historical player performance in Brawlhalla esports tournaments.

This is the version 1.0 section, which will be deprecated soon. This version will only return start.gg tournaments. No tournaments or data from Challengermode will be returned.

Need help migrating?
