# Brawlhalla Stats API

**This is the Version 1.0 section. Version 1.0 is still usable, but is deprecated. Users seeking data from Challengermode tournaments must upgrade to Version 2.0.**

The Brawlhalla Stats API allows users to obtain and sort through years of historical esports data. Want to find every person you've ever teamed with? Curious about a dark horse's past pocket legends? Interested in seeing your favorite player's winrate against their rivals? The Stats API can provide all of that and more to the curious user.

Get started quickly by looking at our [Starter Guide](/v1/resources/starter-guide).
