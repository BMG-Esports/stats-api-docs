## What is a SmashId?

A SmashId is a player's unique ID on Start.gg. This ID is not the alphanumeric phrase found on your Start.gg profile, and is only visible through Start.gg's developer API. However, these IDs can be found through <a href="https://prostats.brawlhalla.com">prostats.brawlhalla.com</a>. Every player in the database will have their SmashId at the end of the URL (https://prostats.brawlhalla.com/singles/153043).
